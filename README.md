# MEAanalysis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The multi-electrode array technique (MEA) produces a high quantity of
data relating to excitable cell activity. This data can often be complex
and time-consuming to analyse in a reproducible manner. Furthermore,
limited resources are available to calculate burst parameters for
individual electrodes as opposed to the whole well. The MEAanalysis
package therefore provides a range of functions which can assist MEA
data analysis and exploration, whilst enabling comparison of bursting
parameters between different time intervals. This package has been
designed to be compatible with 12- and 24- well MEA plates.

The package can be installed from gitHub using
devtools::install_github(“egordon2/MEA-analysis-package/MEAanalysis”) or
by cloning the repository
(<https://github.com/egordon2/MEA-analysis-package>). Once the package
is installed it can be loaded using the library(“MEAanalysis”) command.

Example workflows to demonstrate how this package may be used to analyse
MEA data have also been provided on the package website available here:
<https://egordon2.github.io/MEA-analysis-package/>. Please see the
function help pages for more detailed information on their purpose and
arguments.
