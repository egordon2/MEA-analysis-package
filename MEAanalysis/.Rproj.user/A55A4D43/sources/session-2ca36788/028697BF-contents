# MEAanalysis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The multi-electrode array technique (MEA) produces a high quantity of
data relating to excitable cell activity. This data can be complex and
time-consuming to analyse in a reproducible manner. Furthermore, there
are limited resources available to analyse data collected by single
electrodes as opposed to the whole well average. The MEAanalysis package
has therefore been developed to provide a range of functions which can
assist MEA data analysis and enable comparison of bursting parameters
between time intervals. It has been designed to be used alongside the
outputs produced by the axis navigator suite, in particular datasets
relating to electrode burst and neural metric data.

Three key example workflows have been included in this package:

1)  To create a bar chart visualisation of either number of bursts,
    number of spikes per burst, burst duration, and mean inter-spike
    interval within a burst for single electrodes.
2)  To create a bar chart visualisation of either average number of
    bursts, number of spikes per burst, burst duration, and mean
    inter-spike interval within a burst for each well.
3)  To create a heatmap visualisation of the well average synchrony
    index recorded by an MEA.

Detailed information on function purpose and arguments has been provided
in the associated help pages.
