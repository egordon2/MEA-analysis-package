# MEAanalysis

<!-- badges: start -->

The multi-electrode array technique (MEA) produces a high quantity of data relating to excitable cell activity. This data can often be complex and time-consuming to analyse in a reproducible manner. Furthermore, limited resources are available to calculate burst parameters for individual electrodes as opposed to the whole well. The MEAanalysis package therefore provides a range of functions which can assist MEA data analysis and enable comparison of bursting parameters between different time intervals.

The package can be installed from gitHub using devtools::install_github("egordon2/MEA-analysis-package/MEAanalysis").

Example workflows to demonstrate how this package may be used to analyse MEA data have also been provided on the package website available here: https://egordon2.github.io/MEA-analysis-package/. Please see the function help pages for more detailed information on their purpose and arguments.
