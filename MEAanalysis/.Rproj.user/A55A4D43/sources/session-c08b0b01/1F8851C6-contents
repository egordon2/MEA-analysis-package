# Introduction

The multi-electrode array technique (MEA) produces a high quantity of data relating to excitable cell activity. This data can often be complex and time-consuming to analyse in a reproducible manner. Furthermore, limited resources are available to calculate burst parameters for individual electrodes as opposed to the whole well. The MEAanalysis package has therefore been developed to provide a range of functions which can assist MEA data analysis and enable comparison of bursting parameters between different time intervals.

# Installation 

The package can be installed from gitHub using  devtools::install_github("egordon2/MEA-analysis-package/MEAanalysis").
