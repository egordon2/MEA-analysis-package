# MEAanalysis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The multi-electrode array technique (MEA) produces a high quantity of data relating to excitable cell activity. This data can be complex and time-consuming to analyse in a reproducible manner. Furthermore, there are limited resources available to analyse data collected by single electrodes as opposed to the whole well average. The MEAanalysis package has therefore been developed to provide a range of functions which can assist MEA data analysis and enable comparison of bursting parameters between time intervals. The current package version has been developed to be used alongside the outputs produced by the axis navigator suite (version 3.6.2, Axion Biosystems), in particular datasets relating to electrode burst and neural metric data.

Three key example workflows have been included in this package:

1) To create a bar chart visualisation of either number of bursts, number of spikes per burst, burst duration, and mean inter-spike interval within a burst for single electrodes.
2) To create a bar chart visualisation of either average number of bursts, number of spikes per burst, burst duration, and mean inter-spike interval within a burst for each well.
3) To create a heatmap visualisation of the well average synchrony index recorded by an MEA.

Detailed information on function purpose and arguments has been provided in the associated help pages. 

Package can be installed from gitHub using devtools::install_github("egordon2/MEA-analysis-package/MEAanalysis").
